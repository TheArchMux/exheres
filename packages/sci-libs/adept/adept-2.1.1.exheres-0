SUMMARY="A fast automatic differentiation library for C++"
DESCRIPTION="Adept (Automatic Differentiation using Expression Templates) is a software library that
enables algorithms written in C and C++ to be automatically differentiated. It uses an operator
overloading approach, so very little code modification is required. Differentiation can be performed
in forward mode, reverse mode (to compute the adjoint), or the full Jacobian matrix can be
computed."
